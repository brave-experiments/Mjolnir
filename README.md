## Getting started

### Development mode
To run project locally type:

`bin/run`

### Test
To run tests without watcher:

`bin/run test`

### Test-watch
To run test watcher type:

`bin/run test-watch`

### Build
To build from source:
`bin/run ci`

After success built files will lay within ./dist/{arch}/{binaryName}

To execute apollo binary file:
try `./apollo` to see all commands that are registered
try `./apollo {cmdName} --help` to see help from command

### Quorum execution
after build
`./apollo apply quorum {values.yml}`

### Providing values
See `example/values.yml` that shows how to attach values to apply execution. 
Since any `values-local.yml` file is gitignored
you should copy `example/values.yml` to `values-local.yml` and provide values that you need.

In test mode cli runs with isolated scope with predefined variables and constants.

### Further debugging
After execution of `apply` command certain files will be created on your host:
- `temp.tf` at root of execution dir, which contains whole terraform code that has been executed
- `terraform.tfstate` at root of execution dir, which contains state of execution
- `variables.log` at root of execution dir, which contains last executed variables in recipe
- `.apollo` dir which contains necessary files like ssh key pair to bastion
- `.apollo/$bastion-name/` is a dir where should end private and public key pair
> Also see CONTRIBUTING.md


## Manually running build

To manually test build please run 

`bin/run`  - or get latest binary release from here: https://github.com/brave-experiments/apollo-devops/releases 

To execute apollo CLI run:

`./apollo apply quorum values.yml`  - with previosly prepared values.yml taken from `examples/` folder in repo

After successful you will find following files in your working directory:
* default.tfstate   - current terraform object state
* temp.tf           - full dump of terraform code
* variables.log     - log file with provided vatiables


As we don't have a working output function yet ( depends of Blazej availability  should be ready  tomorrow 4.09.2019 )
you need to run following command on `default.tfstate` file to extract deployment details.

`cat default.tfstate | jq '.modules[0].outputs'`

This will show you a json formated list of outputs including:
* _status           - deployment details
* bastion_host_ip   - bastion public IP
* bucket_name       - S3 bucket name with deployment meta files
* chain_id          - deploy chain ID
* ecs_cluster_name  - full cluster name combined of provided vars
* network_name      - provided network_name
* private_key_file  - SSH key for bastion and cluster nodes

In order to get the current node list please login to bastion using the key:

`ssh -i .apollo/$bastion-name/id_rsa.pem ec2-user@bastion_host_ip`

On bastion you will find Node{n} scripts. To get nodes IP addresses for each one run:

`cat /usr/local/bin/Node*`

You can then connect to each node from your workstation using the same key like for bastion.

Additional tools you will find under links
* eth-stats: http://bastion_host_ip:3000
* Grafana: http://bastion_host_ip:3001
* Prometheus: http://bastion_host_ip:9090
